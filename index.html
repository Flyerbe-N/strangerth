            The Duffer Brothers developed Stranger Things as a mix of investigative drama and supernatural elements portrayed with horror and 
            childlike sensibilities, while infusing references to the pop culture of the 1980s. Several thematic and directorial elements were 
            inspired by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, David Lynch, Stephen King, Wes Craven and H. P. Lovecraft. They also took 
            inspiration from experiments conducted during the Cold War and conspiracy theories involving secret government programs.

            positively for its characterization, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to 1980s films. It has received
